🪶 Poster: `Wanted_Whisper_Tip.jpg`  
Mechanic: Player receives randomized scrolls from Wingston each moon phase or when specific familiars are active.

#### Example Scroll Triggers:
- 🐸 Wartimus active → Scroll glows green, hinting at “pickle contraband.”
- 🐈 Nyx active → Moon symbol scratched into paper.
- 🦉 Wingston himself → "HOOT IF FOUND" scribbled backwards.

**Cursed Mechanic:**  
If the player is carrying an active curse—  
> The poster recognizes them.  
> Name glows red.  
> Scroll becomes a **bounty**.

Only way out? Complete a petty quest… or bribe the owl. 😈
