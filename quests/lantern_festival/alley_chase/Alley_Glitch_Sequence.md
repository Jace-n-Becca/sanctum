# The Lantern Festival Trick – Cloaked Alley Sequence

**Scene:** Festival Night → Alley Detour  
**Files:** Cloaked_Alley*.jpeg, Cloaked_Frontal_Alley.jpeg  
**Trigger:** Missed talisman pickup or failed charm check

---

**Branching Paths:**
- 🔍 Investigate the cloaked figure → receive a riddle
- 🏃‍♀️ Chase the figure → enter mist loop
- 🪞 Ignore → echo of yourself appears instead

---

**Time Loop Effect:**  
If the talisman is missed, a card reappears—same face, *wrong suit*—and resets the alley from the top.

> “Same card. Different truth. You sure you’re not cursed, sweetheart?”

**Escape Condition:**  
Pick up the talisman.  
Pull the right Ace.  
Dare to follow the mist… without turning back.
