# The Four Aces Spread – Origin Ritual

**Location:** Seraphine’s Cottage (Tarot Table)  
**Function:** Interactive soul-alignment tarot puzzle  

---

They say the stars drew four cards the night Jace was born:  
- **Ace of Cups** – *Divine empathy*  
- **Ace of Wands** – *Wild inspiration*  
- **Ace of Swords** – *Unforgiving truth*  
- **Ace of Pentacles** – *Rooted abundance*

But the alignment shifts with every seeker.  
Pull the aces in *soul-matched order*, or summon distortion.

> _"The wrong suit at the right time can tear a heart open... or seal it shut."_  
—Seraphine

**Glitch mechanic:**  
One card repeats elsewhere—wrong suit, same face.  
It was never just a reading… it was a prophecy.
