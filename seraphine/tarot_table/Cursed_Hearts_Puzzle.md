# Cursed Hearts & Cosmic Lies â€“ Puzzle Logic

**Spread Triggered In:**  
- Seraphineâ€™s Table  
- Velvet Domain  
- Post-Romance Disruption Events

---

Players are shown the Four Acesâ€”same as the original spread.  
But one is a **fake**. A cursed distortion.  
If they choose the false card, the entire love forecast burns into a lie.

**Outcome options:**
- Choose correctly â†’ Hidden truth revealed about a connection.
- Choose incorrectly â†’ Romantic sabotage, loss of charm bonus, permanent rift unlock.

ðŸ–¤ *One card reappears later in the alley chaseâ€”out of context, out of time.*  
Pull it againâ€¦ and the loop begins.
